# cr8s-fe: Rust Web Application with Yew

A sample frontend application demonstrating web development in Rust using Yew, showcasing how to build efficient, reliable web applications compiled to WebAssembly.

## Project Overview

This project illustrates building a complex web application in Rust, leveraging Yew and WebAssembly to create a modern, performant web interface.

### Target Audience
#### This project is ideal for developers who
- Have advanced Rust programming skills
- Are interested in exploring WebAssembly (WASM) for web development
- Want a comprehensive example of a Rust-based web application
- Seek a reference implementation for Rust web technologies

### Key Features

#### The application demonstrates:
- Robust authentication mechanisms
- Multi-page routing
- Comprehensive CRUD form handling
- Advanced state management with custom hooks and reducers
- Asynchronous API interactions using browser's fetch API

### Technology Highlights

#### WebAssembly (WASM)
- Binary instruction format supported by modern browsers
- Enables high-performance web applications
- Supports compilation from Rust, C, C++, Go, and other languages

#### Rust's Unique Advantages
- Most popular language for WebAssembly development
- Consistently ranked as StackOverflow's most loved programming language
- Provides memory safety, concurrency, and performance benefits

### Motivation for using Rust
- Strong type safety
- Zero-cost abstractions
- Efficient memory management
- Compile-time guarantees
- Excellent performance characteristics
